## What they dont teach you at uni.... Git
Follow this guide and you be fine :D, some ide's have git but you can always download git bash for windows, however you can use https://git-fork.com/ which was recommended by my boss as its good for noobs like us.

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CSI3105-ST-Group-ECU/planner-20.git
    git checkout -b your-branch-name    ## creat new branch and swap to it
    git branch                          ## list branches
    git status                          ## shows changes
    git add .                           ## add all changes     
    git commit -m "message here"        ## commits locally the changes
    git push origin your-branch-name    ## it will create new or add to exsiting
    ##Go to the repo in GitHub and create the pull request!
